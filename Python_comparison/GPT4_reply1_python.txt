Here's a simple implementation of the lift challenge:

<see lift_attempt.py>

This code defines a Lift class and a simulate_lift function to run the simulation. The Lift class handles lift requests, floor selection, lift movement, and displays the current state of the lift. The simulate_lift function runs the simulation loop, accepting user input for lift requests and floor selection.

To run the simulation, simply execute the code. The simulation will display the lift's state and accept user input for floor requests and floor selection. To stop the simulation, enter 'q'.
