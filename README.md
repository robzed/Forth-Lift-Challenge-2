## About the document here

The document lift2.txt is the supplied text to ChatGPT4. Potentially it's too long for it to injest - however, I didn't check it before submitting it. Attempt 1 code is output.


## About the code here

Because I was late to the game, I decided to get ChatGPT4 to help me. It's first attempt was not bad, but certainly won't run without changes.

Some of the code contains changes and novel code additions and prompts by me. It's not just the output of ChatGPT4. Therefore this code is Copyright (c) 2023 Rob Probin. However, it's licensed under the premissive MIT license - which gives a lot of flexibility.
